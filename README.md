# Outliers

An outlier is a data point that is noticeably different from the rest. They represent errors in measurement, bad data collection, or simply show variables not considered when collecting the data.

Outliers can be detected and removed in 3 ways I have discussed in this notebook.
1. Z-score treatment (Normal distribution)
2. IQR based filtering (Skewed distribution)
3. Percentile method

It is removed using
1. Trimming
2. Capping

In this notebook I have implemented all the methods of outlier detection and removal.
Thank you!!
